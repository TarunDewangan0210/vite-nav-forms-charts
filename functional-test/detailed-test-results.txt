DEPENDENCY STATUS:
-----------------
✅ @testing-library/react - INSTALLED
✅ @testing-library/jest-dom - INSTALLED
✅ @testing-library/user-event - INSTALLED
❌ @vitest/coverage-v8 - NOT INSTALLED (React 19 compatibility issues)

COVERAGE ATTEMPT:
----------------
Coverage testing failed due to dependency conflicts with React 19.
Error: ERESOLVE could not resolve peer dependencies for @visx/axis@3.12.0

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
-----------------
1. Test Assertion Mismatches:
   - Theme selector test expects "Light" but gets "light"
   - Mobile menu CSS class expectations don't match implementation

2. React 19 Compatibility:
   - Several packages have peer dependency conflicts with React 19
   - @visx/axis requires React ^16.3.0-0 || ^17.0.0-0 || ^18.0.0-0
   - Coverage tools cannot be installed due to these conflicts

3. Test Implementation Issues:
   - Mobile menu toggle test doesn't properly simulate user interaction
   - State updates need to be wrapped in act() for proper testing

RECOMMENDATIONS:
---------------
1. Fix Test Assertions:
   - Update theme selector test to expect "light" instead of "Light"
   - Verify mobile menu CSS classes and update test expectations

2. Improve Test Quality:
   - Wrap state updates in act() to eliminate warnings
   - Use proper user event simulation for mobile menu testing

3. Address Dependency Conflicts:
   - Consider downgrading React to 18.x for better ecosystem compatibility
   - Or wait for @visx and other packages to support React 19

4. Add More Test Coverage:
   - Create tests for Dashboard component
   - Add tests for CheckInForm component
   - Test chart data processing utilities

NEXT STEPS:
----------
1. Fix the 2 failing test assertions
2. Add act() wrapper for state updates
3. Expand test coverage to other components
4. Consider React version compatibility for full ecosystem support
