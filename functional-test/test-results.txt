ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
-----------------
1. Missing Testing Library Dependencies:
   - @testing-library/react is not installed
   - This prevents component testing from running

2. Test Coverage:
   - Only utility functions are currently being tested
   - Component tests are failing due to missing dependencies

RECOMMENDATIONS:
---------------
1. Install missing testing dependencies:
   npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event

2. Update test configuration to include proper setup for React Testing Library

3. Once dependencies are installed, re-run tests to verify component testing works

NEXT STEPS:
----------
- Fix dependency issues
- Run tests with coverage: npm run test:coverage
- Verify all tests pass
- Add more comprehensive test coverage
